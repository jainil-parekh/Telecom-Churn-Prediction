# Telco Customer Churn Prediction ðŸ“‰ðŸ“ˆ

This project applies machine learning to predict whether a telecom customer is likely to churn, based on demographic, service usage, and billing data. It's designed to showcase skills in ML modeling, data preprocessing, evaluation, and model deployment readiness.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

âœ… Trained and compared multiple ML models:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM  
âœ… Evaluated models using:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC  
âœ… Visualized:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ ROC curves and feature importances  
âœ… Built a reusable data preprocessing pipeline  
âœ… Saved the best-performing model using `joblib` for deployment

## ðŸ“¦ Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/telco-customer-churn.git
cd telco-customer-churn

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Notebook
